  <h1>WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?</h1> 
  <br>
  <p>Blockchain had first time public attention in in 2008. A person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto used the blockchain technology to create the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The invention of bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server
    The bitcoin blockchain is the basic of many other cryptocurrencies and modern databases.</p>
  <br>   
  <p> When we have physical money, banks have control of operations by verifying or validating the transactions we perform, they manage records and establish security methods so that transactions cannot be falsified, thus controlling the economics of a country. Cryptocurrencies also have a validation and verification control that system is Blockchain's technology.
    Blockchain proposal is to have all financial records around the Internet, operating in a decentralized manner through millions of computers connected to each other, in order to verify transactions and store it thus avoiding possible fraud.</p>
  <br>
  <p>To understand better this technology, we can establish the following features</p>
  <ol>
    <li> It is a ledger, which records a large amount of transaction which is not altered.</li>
    <li>It allows the recorded data to be distributed anywhere without being able to be duplicated, all thanks to its level of extreme security. </li>
    <li>All information is stored in blocks, and the database is shared, meaning it is not stored in one place, so all records are easy to locate. </li>
    <li>The information can be viewed by anyone on the Internet, as it is stored on millions of linked computers simultaneously.</li>
  </ol>

  <br>

  <h1>WHAT IS MINING?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The Governments are currently responsible for printing the physical money, used by their citizens to purchase goods or services, all regulated with their internal laws. Cryptocurrencies are not created but discovered on the internet, this discovery process is known as mining. Cryptocurrency mining are all processes performed by a server or computer, required for the validation and registration of the financial transactions within a Blockchain.
  Validation methods such as cryptocurrency mining are called proof of work or PoW and are one of the reasons why cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology are considered so innovative.</p>
  <br>
  <p>When the technology first appeared, anyone with a computer could exercise bitcoin mining, as transactions and currency use increased, requiring more power for the development of mathematical algorithms required by Blockchain, currently using powerful devices specific to mining. Mining requires the solution of mathematical problems generated by the volume of transactions made, each minner receive an award once the miner finds the solution to any problem and solves it so that the transaction is verified and stored in the Blockchain, this award is in the currency being mined when closing the block.</p>
  <br>
  <p>For the production of cryptocurrencies miners employ a system based on highly sophisticated algorithms, whose objective is the release of currency blocks, which will then enter circulation in the virtual market. There are different types of cryptocurrencies, so there are different types of algorithms.
      As more coins are extracted, the difficulty of procedures in Blockchain and the release of new cryptocurrencies increases, this has been designed in this way in order to guarantee the community, that all cryptocurrencies cannot be extracted immediately. It is important to mention that there is a limit of existence in each cryptocurrency, in the case of Bitcoin there are only 21,000,000, once the 21,000,000 will be released there will be no more.</p>

  <h1>WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET</h1>
  <br>
  <p>A cryptocurrency wallet is software or hardware that makes an encrypted wallet or virtual wallet providing full security to save, send and receive Bitcoin, Ethereum or any cryptocurrency or data. Wallets can be compatible with a single cryptocurrency, such as official wallets, or on the other hand, multi-desktop wallets, commonly created by third parties. You want to learn how to buy Bitcoin, we have an article that explains in simple steps how to make the purchase of your first Bitcoin posible. A simpler definition may be: a software to store or save, receive and send your cryptocurrencies.
  </p>
  <h1>TYPE OF WALLETS</h1>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Cold Wallets: They are those physical devices created to store your cryptocurrencies and keep the security keys securely within them, whose format is the same as a pendrive, which you connect to your computer to be used. These devices are designed to provide security and protect your cryptocurrency, using a security code that allows the creation of secure keys and never leave the device. Another important aspect is that if someone tries to physically manipulate the device to access its private keys it self-destructs and completely deletes the keys. They are ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies, their appearance is like that of a USB, which has a security chip where the keys are stored and that cannot leave the device. There are two large models of Hardware Wallet on the market; The Trezor and the Ledgers. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Hot Wallet: They are online wallets that allow users to comfortably manage cryptocurrencies. They are mostly easy to use and very effective, they are connected to the internet and Blockchain. This type of wallet have a system of private and secret keys that only the user knows, but being connected to the internet they risk being hacked, so they are not recommended to store large amounts of Bitcoin, they are ideal for making payments for goods and services. They can be downloaded to computers, be on the network through an Exchange platform or an app on your mobile device. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Paper Wallet: are printed wallets, this type of wallets offer a higher level of security compared to other Wallets since their storage is done off the internet. Through it you will be able to save or store your keys more safely as long as the download process is done correctly. On the printed paper you will have the private keys and addresses necessary for the management of cryptocurrencies. Because of its cold storage model and off-line feature, they cannot be hacked or infected with viruses. This type of wallet is recommended to save cryptocurrencies that will not be used in a long time, those that are held as investment or savings.</li>
    </ol>
